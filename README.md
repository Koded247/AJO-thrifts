# 💰 Àjọ Savings – Decentralized Group Savings Protocol

**Àjọ Savings** is a smart contract-based group savings platform built on Ethereum. It allows users to create and participate in trustless, rotating savings groups using stablecoins — no banks, no middlemen.

---

## 🚀 What is Àjọ Savings?

Àjọ Savings brings traditional *“thrift”* and *“ajo”* models on-chain. With a few clicks, users can form savings groups where each member contributes periodically (weekly/monthly), and one member receives a payout per cycle — until everyone has received theirs.

- 🏗 Create or join custom savings groups
- ⏱ Choose between **weekly** or **monthly** cycles
- 👥 Group sizes of 2 or more members
- 🔒 Fully automated, trustless disbursements
- 💸 Stablecoin-based (USDC, USDT, etc.)

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Factory Pattern** – Deploy isolated group contracts via a secure factory contract
- **Automated Disbursements** – Funds are rotated on-chain based on the schedule
- **No Intermediary Risk** – Funds are locked in smart contracts, not with any individual
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Clean frontend for easy creation, joining, and tracking
- **Gas-Optimized Logic** – Efficient and scalable Solidity code
